    Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection
Darwin's most important discovery is that species evolve over time through a process called natural selection. This means organisms with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to the next generation.

This theory was published in his 1859 book, “On the Origin of Species”, and it changed the way we understand life on Earth.

</p>
<p>Darwin proposed that species can change over time, that new species come from pre-existing species, and that all species share a common ancestor. In this model, each species has its own unique set of heritable (genetic) differences from the common ancestor, which have accumulated gradually over very long time periods. Repeated branching events, in which new species split off from a common ancestor, produce a multi-level "tree" that links all living organisms.</p>
<p>Importantly, Darwin didn't just propose that organisms evolved. If that had been the beginning and end of his theory, he wouldn't be in as many textbooks as he is today! Instead, Darwin also proposed a mechanism for evolution: natural selection. This mechanism was elegant and logical, and it explained how populations could evolve (undergo descent with modification) in such a way that they became better suited to their environments over time.</p>

        <li>
            Sexual Selection: A form of natural selection where traits evolve because they increase an individual's chances of mating.
<li>

    Common Ancestry: Darwin proposed that all species of life are related and have descended from a common ancestor.
</li>
<li>

    Plant Movement Studies: He studied how plants respond to light and gravity.
</li>
<li>

    Earthworm Behavior: He showed how earthworms enrich soil, which was one of his last studies.
